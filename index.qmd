## Quick Demo

Try editing and running this code:

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np

# Calculate the square root of 2 using Newton's method
x = 2.0  # Starting guess
for i in range(5):
    x = x - (x**2 - 2) / (2*x)
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {x:.15f}")

print(f"\nTrue value:   {np.sqrt(2):.15f}")
```
